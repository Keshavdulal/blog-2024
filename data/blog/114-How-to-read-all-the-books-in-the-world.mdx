# How to read all the books in the world?

Have you ever wondered how many books are out there in the world?

I found out that there are approximately **130 million** books globallyâ€”and counting! As a non-voracious reader, I often find myself overwhelmed with the fear of missing out (FOMO) on all the amazing books that exist.

## The Impossible Task of Reading All the Books

Letâ€™s assume, for a moment, that you manage to read one book every single day of your life, and you live to be **100 years old**. Even with that incredible feat, youâ€™d only manage to read **36,500 books** in your lifetime. Out of **134 million** books, thatâ€™s barely **0.03%** of the total number of books!

And letâ€™s not forget our friend, *compounding*. Over the course of your 100-year life, another **20 million books** would be published, at the rate of 200,000 new books per year. So, even with this insane hypothetical reading speed, weâ€™d still only be able to read a tiny fraction of the worldâ€™s knowledge. 

## My Struggle with FOMO

For the longest time, I carried this FOMO in my heart (or maybe my head). Anytime Iâ€™d sit down to read a book, Iâ€™d feel stressed. It seemed to take forever to finish a chapter, and I couldnâ€™t enjoy the process because I kept thinking about all the other books I could be reading.

That was until I stumbled upon a simple yet profound idea that changed my perspective.

## The Solution: Focus on the Best Books

I realized that itâ€™s not about reading *all* the booksâ€”itâ€™s about reading the **best** ones. Iâ€™d rather read the **top 100 books** repeatedly, absorbing their wisdom, than attempt to skim through everything.

I was mind-blown. This idea solved my FOMO. Instead of worrying about the countless books Iâ€™d never get to read, I could focus on mastering the most influential ones.

## Finding the Best Books

To start my journey, I did a simple Google search (you could also use AI). I found several websites that rank books based on various criteria. After some exploration, I settled on **Goodbooks** (no affiliation). This site collects book recommendations from successful people worldwideâ€”authors, scientists, businesspeople, and more. It then ranks the books based on how many influential people recommend them.

This approach has worked wonderfully for me, but thereâ€™s a tiny problem.

## The Age of Instant Gratification

We live in a world where instant gratification is the norm. Want to buy something? Done. Want to download something? Done. But some thingsâ€”like building a business or mastering a new skillâ€”just take time. As **Edward O. Wilson** once said, *"We have stone-age emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology."*

So, even though I narrowed down 134 million books to the top 100, I was still frustrated. I still had to read all those books!

## My Method: Summarizing the Top 100 Books

What I did was create summaries of the top 100 books. I used **ChatGPT** to summarize each book and break down its chapters, so I could get the key takeaways with minimal time investment. If youâ€™re interested, you can get this PDF by clicking the link in the description.

But take this idea with a grain of salt. Summarizing books gives you a quick overview but skips the depth and nuance that the author intended. AI-generated summaries often feel bland, like a smoothie that gives you the nutrients but none of the flavor.

## Grouping Related Books

Another benefit of this approach is that I could group related books together. For example, I created categories such as:

- **Biographies**
- **Personal Development**
- **Philosophy**
- **Science**
- **Business**
- **Human Psychology**

But thereâ€™s still a drawback. If you have niche interests, like ancient literature or psychedelics, you wonâ€™t find many recommendations on mainstream websites. So, I did my own research for those topics and again summarized the books I found.

## Conclusion: A Temporary Solution to FOMO

This isnâ€™t a perfect approach, and Iâ€™m not suggesting you only read summaries and never touch a full book. However, as a temporary solution to control your FOMO and focus on high-quality content, I think this method works well.

If youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed or donâ€™t know where to start, using pre-made summaries can help you get a sense of which books to dive deeper into. Itâ€™s been incredibly helpful for me, and I hope it helps you too.
